    <string name="profile_bio_text">Hi! My name is Johnny Phan as you may have read above. I am currently in the process of body building to strive for better health and also for the looks of course :). Recently, I discovered that I wanted to work in the mobile app development field in order to create apps that can help better people\'s mental health, especially with people who grew up with emotional absent figure(s) in their life. Through this, people can be emotionally open about their feelings and learn how to solve this type of issue in the healthiest way possible!
